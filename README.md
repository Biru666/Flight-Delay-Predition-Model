# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction Model

A machine-learning project that predicts whether a flight will be delayed using historical flight and weather data.

## 🚀 Overview
This project cleans real flight datasets, engineers features (time, airport, airline, weather), and trains ML models to forecast delays. The goal is to support smarter scheduling and improve travel reliability.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- Feature engineering (weather, time, airport trends)  
- ML model training & evaluation  
- Delay prediction for new flights  

## 📦 Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## ▶️ Usage
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
