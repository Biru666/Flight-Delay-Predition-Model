# ✈️ Flight Delay Prediction Model

A machine-learning project that predicts whether a flight will be delayed using historical flight and weather data.

## 🚀 Overview
This project cleans real flight datasets, engineers features (time, airport, airline, weather), and trains ML models to forecast delays. The goal is to support smarter scheduling and improve travel reliability.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Feature Selection
- ML model training & evaluation  
- Delay prediction for new flights  

## 📦 Technologies
- Pandas 
- Scikit-Learn  
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn  
- Pyspark 

## 📂 Dataset

Historical U.S. flight data + weather info provided by Rob Mulla from Kaggle. This 
dataset contains all flight information including cancellation and delays by airlines for 2022. The data 
was extracted from the Marketing Carrier On-Time Performance data table of the “On-Time” database 
from the TranStats data library.
