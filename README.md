## Project Overview

Flight delays represent a major operational challenge in aviation, affecting airlines, airports, and passengers alike. This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates the delay of flights (or the probability of delay) using historical data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to support improved scheduling, resource allocation, and decision-making in aviation operations.

## Features

- Data ingestion and cleaning pipeline for flight and weather data  
- Feature engineering: airport, airline, scheduled times, weather, delay history  
- Model training and evaluation: regression (delay time) and/or classification (delayed vs on-time)  
- Evaluation metrics such as MAE, RMSE, accuracy, recall, etc.  
- Exported model and inference script for predicting new flights  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+  
- Required libraries (see `requirements.txt`)  
- Sufficient compute resources to train model on dataset  

### Installation & Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Biru666/Flight-Delay-Prediction-Model.git
cd Flight-Delay-Prediction-Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
